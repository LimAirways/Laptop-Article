        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This laptop is a 2 in 1 convertible with a 360&deg;, allowing it to transform into a ipad to take notes or drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
         With an AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 8645HS Processor, this laptop can handle heavy duty work such as Programming and normal everyday work with ease.

          <h3>Display</h3>
          <p>This laptop has a 14" display with WUXGA (1920 x 1200), IPS, Glare, Touchscreen. </p>
          <p>It also has a 45%NTSC, 300 nits of brightness, 60Hz refresh rate on the screen. </p>
          <p>This laptop is suitable for everyday usage. </p>
          <p>However, it is not recommended to use this laptop for creative uses such as professional video editing and drawing due to its low 45%NTSC display. </p>
          <p>Other than that, this beast of a laptop can handle other works with ease.</p>
          <p>The 300 nits brightness is enough brightness to be able to see the contents of the screen while exposed under bright sun or other bright light sources.</p>
